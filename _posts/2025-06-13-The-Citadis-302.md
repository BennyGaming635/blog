## The Citadis 302
The fan-favourite tram in Adelaide created by Alstom. Originally Adelaide wasn't even planning of obtaining new Low-Floor trams but that changed when Metro Ligero in Madrid needed to suddenly sell some trams due to budget constraints. Adelaide also has Flexity Classics which you can read about [here](https://bennygaming635.github.io/blog/2025/06/13/The-Citadis-302.html).

Currently Adelaide Metro (Operated by Torrens Connect) has six Alstom Citadis 302s built. They seat 54 and use the standard 1435 mm guage. Now you may be thinking... 'These trams look familiar to something in Melbourne!' which is true because they are also completely low floor and fun fact - They were both made in the same place (La Rochelle). But the C2 in Melbourne are also commonly nicknamed "Bumblebees" due to their original skin but now they have the good-old PTV Tram skin but still have retained a little Bumblebee touch.
