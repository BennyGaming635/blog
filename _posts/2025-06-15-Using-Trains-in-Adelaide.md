## Using Trains for Public Transit in Adelaide

Adelaide has a train network (Like most places in Australia) but it's a lot smaller than the others mainly due to stupid things the government did. But atlast here's a post on using our train network.

### The Lines
The Adelaide Suburban Train Network has 6 main lines which are all government-operated (Unlike Melbourne) and all leave from **Adelaide Railway Station** on North Terrace.

**Seaford Line** – South to Seaford via Brighton and Noarlunga.

**Flinders Line** – Short branch line to Flinders Medical Centre & University.

**Gawler Line** – North to Gawler Central (now fully electrified).

**Outer Harbor Line** – Northwest to Port Adelaide and Outer Harbor.

**Grange Line** – Short spur to Grange Beach.

**Belair Line** – Southeast into the foothills and Belair National Park.

Each line also has a colour on timetables and maps as well as some stations containing their colour has a main building theme.

### Fares
You can pay with many methods but heres the rundown:
Are you a?
Senior - Use a Seniors Card for free travel.
Student - Buy a Student Metrocard for 75% off travel.
Concession - Buy a Concession Metrocard for 50% off travel.
Regular - Either use your card or regular metrocard.

Single-trip paper tickets are still available and you can get them at the infoCentre at Adelaide Railway Station.

### Find your station.

It's very easy to find a station as you'll probably hear a train if you're nearby but you can find your nearest station by using tools such as [the Adelaide Metro journey planner](https://www.adelaidemetro.com.au/plan-a-trip/plan-my-journey), Google Maps, transit apps like Moovit and Transit.

Most major stations have shelters, seating and electronic displays. Smaller (and less used) stations normally don't have these amenities but a shelter and basic signage are typical.


### Adelaide Railway Station
At Adelaide Railway Station (Which is the fanciest train station in SA) you can find all the train lines which are listed above and you're basically near everything. You can hop on a tram to places like Rundle Mall and Victoria Square for free and once the new tram bridge is completed you'll also be able to go to Glenelg (again).

The infoCentre is present here as well as facitities like shops, ATMs, recharge points for your MetroCard and toilets.

Fun fact - Only major railway station in Australia not connected to other cities as all 'regional' trains use the Parklands Terminal. (We don't have anything like V-Line though).
