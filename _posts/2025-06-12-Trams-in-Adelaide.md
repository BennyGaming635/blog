## Trams in Adelaide

Adelaide *used* to have many tram lines going around many areas but due to some silly government changes and the thought of that the *cars were the future* meant that it all mostly got ripped up. But the Glenelg line still stayed but as of this writing is currently closed while they (The Department of Infrastructure and Transport (Or just DIT)) are rebuilding the tramway bridge.

Now Adelaide has two types of trams which are the Flexity Classic (100 Class) and Citadis 302 (200 Class). There used to be some H Types (300 Class) running on only the Glenelg line and were the *vintage* trams as they joined the state-network in **1929!**. But as of 2015 they were no longer used but moved around a fair bit. Now Tram 361 and Tram 376 are now at a business called 'Mist on Bridgewater' in the Adelaide Hills.
