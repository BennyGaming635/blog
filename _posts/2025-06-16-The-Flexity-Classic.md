## The Flexity Classic
Short blog today.
Anyways, the *slightly* smaller tram called the Flexity Classic in the Adelaide network is used with 15 trams built by Bombardier.

These trams have three segments and contain 70% low-floor capacity, seats for 64 people and space for another 115 to stand. Fun fact - Even though the newer [200 Class](https://bennygaming635.github.io/blog/2025/06/13/The-Citadis-302.html) looks fancier and newer, they actually have less capacity then the Flexity Classic. I guess that's why the government keeps ordering them!

The first contract was for 9 trams with the first three of this new fleet arriving in November of 2005. Tram 103 was damaged in transit so another one was sent as a replacement. With all these new trams entering service at the start of 2006. The last arrived in Melbourne and moved via road to Adelaide in September that year. Two more were ordered in 2005 with those arriving in 2007 after the extension of the King William Street.

Once again another 4 were ordered after the extension to the Adelaide Entertainment Centre in June 2008 with them entering service in 2011 and 2012.
